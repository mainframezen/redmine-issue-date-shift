= issue_date_shift

This plugin is called when editing an issue.

The objective is to change the dates of issues that happen after the edited one, as if this is a predecessor of all of those.

Imagine I have a task (A) that happens betweeen 1st April and April 3. Another task (B) happens from April 6 to April 9.
This is year 2009. Just in case...

Now my fellow co-worker tells me that task A will finish on April 7. What happens to task B?
This plugin will make task B start on April 8 and finish April 13. There a weekend in there...

This is old stuff, do not use
